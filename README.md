# emergency_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The Emergency App - Internship
Developed an Emergency App during the tenure of internship.

• Motive: To provide immediate assistance / help in case of emergency by directly contacting local police station or hospital.

• Why this works? This project severely reduces time lag that causes when one takes conventional way of contacting help, i.e. by calling 100.

• It is decentralized, hence no to very minimal downtime.

• Concept: Every PS / Hospital needs to register their local contact number, which will directly be shared with the person in distress. Nearby PCR vans are also notified in case of emergency.

• Loopholes:
-> Spam calls: temporary ban / revocation of service for user
